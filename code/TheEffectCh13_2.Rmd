Follow the below instructions and turn in both your code and results:

1. Load the `dengue.csv` file provided to you, or from [this site](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/DAAG/dengue.csv). Documentation on the variables is available [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/DAAG/dengue.html).

*Language-specific instructions*: 

- In R or Python, store the data set as `dengue`
- In Stata, some of the variables will be read as text. Use `destring *, replace force` to turn them numeric.

2. Run an OLS regression using average humidity to predict whether dengue was observed in the area, and look at the results.

*Language-specific instructions*: 

- In both R and Python, save the model as `m2`. In R, use the `msummary()` function from the **modelsummary** package to display the results with the `stars = TRUE` option.

3. Write two sentences, one interpreting the intercept and one interpreting the slope.

4. Get a set of summary statistics for the humidity variable and write a comment on how this can help you make sense of the intercept in the regression from step 2.

*Language-specific instructions*:

- We didn't cover easy summary statistics commands in the book. In R you can use `summary()` on the variable. In Stata try `summarize` and in Python, `data['variablename'].describe()`.


5. We might recognize that, if we're interested in the effect of humidity on Dengue, temperature might be on a back door. Add a control for temperature, rerun the regression, and show the results.

*Language-specific instructions*: 

- In both R and Python, save the model as `m5`. In R, use the `msummary()` function from the **modelsummary** package to display the results with the `stars = TRUE` option.

6. Our dependent variable is binary, and we're getting predictions below zero, which we might not want. Rerun the regression from question 5 but as a logit model, and report the marginal effects of both slope coefficients.

*Language-specific instructions*: 

- In both R and Python, save the model as `m6`. In R, use the `msummary()` function from the **modelsummary** package to display the results with the `stars = TRUE` option.


7. A long one: Now let's say we're directly interested in the relationship between temperature and humidity. Run an OLS regression of humidity on temperature. Calculate the residuals of that regression, and then make a plot that will let you evaluate whether there is likely heteroskedasticity in the model. Rerun the model with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. Show both models, and say whether you think there is heteroskedasticity

*Language-specific instructions*: 

- In both R and Python, save the model as `m7`, and `m7b` if you rerun with robust standard errors. 
- In R, use `fiter(!is.na(dengue$humid))` on the data before running the model so the residuals line up properly. Use the `msummary()` function from the **modelsummary** package to display the results with the `stars = TRUE` option. Also, if you're clever about `msummary()` usage, you can skip creating `m7b`. You can access residuals using `resid(m7)`.
- In Stata, you can access residuals using `predict resid, r` after running the model.
- In Python, use `dengue.loc[~pd.isna(dengue['humid'])]` on the data before running the model so the residuals line up properly. You can access residuals using `m7.resid`.


8. In the graph in the last problem you may have noticed that for certain ranges of temperate, the errors were clearly nonzero on average. This can indicate a functional form problem. Run the model from question 7 again (with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors), but this time use the logarithm of humidity in place of humidity. Add a sentence interpreting the coefficient on temperature. 

*Language-specific instructions*: 

- In Python and R, store the model as `m8`. In R, use the `msummary()` function from the **modelsummary** package to display the results with the `stars = TRUE` option. 
- In Stata, you'll need to create logged humidity in the data before running the regression. In R and Python you can do it inside of the regression formula, using `np.log()` from **numpy** in Python.

9. Bonus challenge: figure out how I decided on a form where you log humidity and keep temperature linear.
