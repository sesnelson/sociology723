abstract: \singlespacing The foster care system in the United States emerged out of increasing public concern for children who experience some form of maltreatment. Research on the prevalence of confirmed maltreatment has largely focused on the relationship between maltreatment and placement into foster care. However, in this paper, I investigate the relationship between maltreatment among youth already in care and placement instability.
